<h1> <u> <b>An interface which can display the following queries: </b> </u> </h1>
<br> <br>
<h3>1 :  Popular Names by Birth Year: User can enter a year and choice like Top 10, Top 20..Top 1000 etc and the relevant names will be displayed. Choices should be there
	for only males, only females and both. Name rankings should also include Number of Births. <br>
	<br>
2 :  Popularity of a name that has changed over the years: Given a name and a year it should show (preferably in a graphical format) how popularity has changed
	starting from that particular year till 2013. For example if a user inputs: Brendon and a year 2000 it should show the popularity of the name starting 	from 2000 to 2013. Again choice of Male and Female should be there because some names can be both male and female.
